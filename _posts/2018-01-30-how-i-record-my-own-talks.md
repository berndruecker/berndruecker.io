### How I record my own talks
I started to record my own talks for publishing a year ago. But obviously I do not want to carry around a huge case of expensive equipment to make this happening. So I experimented a while to figure out a setup that works for me. I wrote this post for anybody interested.

#### Environment
Windows 10 Laptop

#### Recording Software
Camtasia from [TechSmith](https://www.techsmith.com/). It is not free, but a great tool to record

- screen
- webcam
- audio

and allow easy post processing. Afterwards you can simply create a mp4 file.

I record my screen for slides as well as live hacking, which I normally do in my talks. I therefor mirror my display on the projector to not get confused.

#### Camera

I use my normal [Logitech HD 920 webcam](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/hd-pro-webcam-c920) which can be mounted on [this Coolway stand](https://www.amazon.de/Coolway®-Krake-Stativ-DSLR-Kamera-Schnellspannclip-Sicherungsring-Schwarz-Grün/dp/B01KJWJP5O/). That the logitech webcam can be mounted on stands is one of the great things about it. Positioning of the camera is typically a bit tricky, but a chair in the front row, a spare flip-chart, an unused microphone stand or whatever you can find might do a good job. This in an example from QCon London:

#### Microphone
I stumbled over the [Samson Stage XPD1 Presentation](http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/wireless-systems/xpd-series/stagexpd1lm5/) which is a really great product. Is a wireless microphone which is plugged into USB and therefor qualifies as normal microphone for Camtasia.

#### Microphone for second speaker
Another tricky part was to have a second microphone for a second speaker. On the positive side you can connect two Samson microphones with one computer.

But there is a big problem: Camtasia cannot handle multiple microphones. I could add an additional audio recorded somewhere else later on, but my experience was, that it is really hard to get the audio files synced in time. So I use another approach: [Virtual Audio Cable](http://software.muzychenko.net/eng/vac.htm) can simply merge multiple audio inputs into a new one. That way, multiple microphones look to Camtasia as one.

If you don’t want to invest in Samson mics, you can also try software to turn your smartphone into a bluetooth microphone, I played around with [Wireless Orange WO Mic](http://www.wirelessorange.com/womic/). I connected a simple microphone with cable to my smartphone and are ready to go. But I had a couple of problems with this setup, so I do not use it any more (the microphone unplugged itself from the smartphone during talks and the bluetooth connection sometimes had a delay or quality problems).

#### Pricing
Components I had anyway:

- Camtasia: 250 €
- Logitech webcam: 100 €

Components I just bought:

- Stand for webcam: 20€
- Samson mic: 100 € each
- Virtual Audio Cable: 25 €

#### The result
This is an example from the QCon London:

And from KanDDDinsky Berlin with two speakers
