### Webinar FAQ for Monitoring & Orchestrating Your Microservices Landscape using Workflow Automation

#### Answering leftover questions from my webinar in March 2020

On Wednesday, March 11, 2020, I conducted the webinar titled “[Monitoring & Orchestrating Your Microservices Landscape using Workflow Automation](https://camunda.com/learn/webinars/microservices-landscape-workflow-automation/)”. Not only was I overwhelmed by the number of attendees, but we also got a huge list of interesting questions before and especially during the webinar. Some of them were answered, but a lot of them were not. I want to answer all open questions in this blog post.

Unfortunately this post got a bit long — sorry, I did not have the time to write a shorter one. Feel free to jump to the question that interests you right away!

- [BPMN & modeling related questions](#a872) (6 answers)
- [Architecture related questions](#67b4) (12)
- [Stack & technology questions](#06ac) (6)
- [Camunda product-related questions](#dd04) (5)
- [Camunda Optimize specific questions](#0432) (3)
- [Questions about best practices](#b941) (5)
- [Questions around project layout, journey and value proposition](#502f) (3)
- [Wrap-Up](#d5d3)

Note that we also started to experiment with the [Camunda’s question corner](https://forum.camunda.org/t/feedback-camundas-question-corner/18828) and discuss to make this more frequent, so keep an eye to our community for more opportunities to ask anything (especially as in-person events are canceled for some time).

You can [find the recording of the webinar online](https://camunda.com/learn/fulfillment/webinars/microservices-landscape-workflow-automation-thank-you/), as well as [the slides](https://www.slideshare.net/camunda/webinar-monitoring-orchestrating-your-microservices-landscape-using-workflow-automation):
